# Android Unsplash (Unofficial)
An unofficial Unsplash API library for Android

## Gradle
Add the line below to your build.gradle to use:
~~~
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.keenencharles:androidunsplash:3.1.2'
}
~~~

## Usage

### Initialize Unsplash Client
~~~~~
val unsplash = Unsplash(YOUR_CLIENT_ID, YOUR_TOKEN);
~~~~~
You can create an app for your project at <https://unsplash.com/developers>
You'll receive a Client ID and a Client Secret

### User Authentication
Unsplash uses OAuth2 for user authentication.

You can call the `authorize()` method to start the process with the scopes you require access to. Ensure those scopes have been turned on in the Unsplash project dashboard.

~~~~~
val scopes = listOf(Scope.PUBLIC, Scope.READ_USER, Scope.WRITE_USER)
unsplash.authorize(this, YOUR_REDIRECT_URI, scopes)
~~~~~

If your app is mobile only you can create a `redirectURI` by [defining a URI scheme](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking) in your Manifest 

Once the user has been redirected to your app you can need to retrieve the `code` parameter provided in the Intent and call the `getToken()` method.

~~~~~
unsplash.getToken(YOUR_SECRET, YOUR_REDIRECT_URI, code, {
		Log.d("Token", it.accessToken)
	}, {
		Log.d("Token", it)
	})
~~~~~

Add the token you receive to your unsplash client to authenticate user-related requests.
~~~~~
unsplash.setToken(token.accessToken);
~~~~~

### Get A List of Photos
~~~~~
unsplash.photos.get(1, 10, Order.LATEST, 
	onComplete = {
		Log.d("Photos", "Photos Found $it")
	},
	onError = {
		Log.d("Unsplash", it)
	}
)
~~~~~

### Get A Photo By Id
~~~~~
unsplash.photos.getById("ID",
	onComplete = {
		Log.d("Photos", "Photo Found $it")
	},
	onError = {
		Log.d("Photos", it)
	}
)
~~~~~

### Search
~~~~~
unsplash.photos.search(query,
	onComplete = {
		Log.d("Photos", "Total Results Found " + it.total!!)
		val photos = it.results
	},
	onError = {
		Log.d("Unsplash", it)
	}
)
~~~~~

## Coroutines
You can also use the library with coroutines by using the same functions without any callbacks.
~~~~~
val res = unsplash.photos.search(query)
if (res is UnsplashResource.Success) {
    Log.d(TAG, "Photos found")
}
else if (res is UnsplashResource.Error) {
    Log.d(TAG, res.errorMessage)
}
~~~~~

## Other Features
You can access other features by using their respective classes.

Collections with `unsplash.collections`

Users with `unsplash.users`

Stats with `unsplash.stats`

Take a look at the API documentation for what each call does in detail <https://unsplash.com/documentation>
